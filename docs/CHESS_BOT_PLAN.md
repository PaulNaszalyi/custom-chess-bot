# Chess Bot Project: Chess.com Analysis + Lichess Bot

## Overview

Create a personalized chess bot that analyzes playing patterns from Chess.com game data and deploys as an automated bot on Lichess.org. The bot will learn from historical games to mimic playing style and decision-making patterns.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Extract comprehensive game data from Chess.com API
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze playing style, opening preferences, tactical patterns
3. **Bot Training**: Create a model that emulates the player's decision-making
4. **Lichess Deployment**: Deploy the trained bot to play on Lichess.org

### Success Metrics
- Bot plays moves that reflect the original player's style
- Maintains similar opening repertoire and tactical preferences
- Achieves comparable playing strength on Lichess

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection
- **Expand Chess.com integration**: Collect player stats, ratings, time controls
- **Game metadata**: Extract opening names, time spent per move, game results
- **Move analysis**: Calculate move accuracy, blunder patterns, time management

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition & Analysis
- **Opening repertoire**: Identify preferred openings as White/Black
- **Tactical patterns**: Analyze common tactical motifs and missed opportunities
- **Positional style**: Determine if player prefers aggressive/positional/defensive play
- **Time management**: Understand thinking time patterns across game phases

### Phase 3: Bot Intelligence
- **Decision engine**: Create algorithm that weighs moves based on learned patterns
- **Style mimicry**: Implement preferences for openings, piece activity, pawn structure
- **Strength calibration**: Adjust playing strength to match original player's level
- **Learning integration**: Optionally incorporate Stockfish for move validation

### Phase 4: Lichess Integration
- **Bot account setup**: Create and configure Lichess bot account
- **API integration**: Connect bot engine to Lichess Bot API
- **Game management**: Handle challenges, time controls, resignation logic
- **Performance monitoring**: Track bot performance and style accuracy

## Technical Stack

### Data Processing
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Core application framework
- **Chess.com API**: Historical game data extraction
- **PGN parsing**: Game analysis and move extraction
- **JSON storage**: Structured data persistence

### Analysis & ML
- **Statistical analysis**: Pattern recognition algorithms
- **Chess libraries**: Position evaluation and move generation
- **Machine learning**: Optional neural network for move prediction

### Bot Framework
- **Lichess Bot API**: Real-time game playing
- **lichess-bot bridge**: Connection between engine and Lichess
- **UCI protocol**: Chess engine communication standard
